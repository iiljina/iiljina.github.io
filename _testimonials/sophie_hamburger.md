Inna’s diligence and commitment had a great impact on our team and organization. She is naturally curious to learn and develop her 
skills and her eye for detail make her very thorough when it comes to the execution of tasks and assignments.

Without reservation and with abundant enthusiasm, I wholeheartedly recommend that you give Inna Iljina every consideration for the position she is applying for.
