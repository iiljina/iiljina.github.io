There is so much that I loved about your [project]({{ project.url }}) but what really stood out was the amount of thought you put into it. 
The way you interpreted the brief, then chose a creative theme and made sure it was the strong red thread across every element of the party - 
taking into to consideration both the teens and the adults throughout - well done.
