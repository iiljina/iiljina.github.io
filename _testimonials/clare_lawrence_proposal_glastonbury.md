The project proposal for [Glastonbury festival]({{ project.url }}) is so perfectly on brief, your delivery is well executed and the attention to detail is surely going to win you pitches.
You really listened to client and interpreted the brief well, delivering a strong creative concept to meet the objectives, well done.
