"Your event [{{ project.title }}]({{ project.url }}) idea was strong, it was a very engaging, fun, tour, one that I believe you could replicate. 
I know you had a number of issues in the planning process, well done for managing them, being resilient and producing a project that delivers on all the objectives."
