It’s a great pleasure to work with Inna. She is a skilled organizer and can easily deal with multitasking or adapting to sudden changes in a project. 
She is eager to take up new challenges, learn and share her experience with others. Her positivity is contagious and her presence in a team is like a ray of sunshine. 
Inna has a creative spirit: her ideas never stop to amaze me and I can always see her passion for making every little detail count. 
Her enthusiasm is truly inspiring and encouraging. I’d love to work with her again in the future!
