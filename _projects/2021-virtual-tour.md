For the online event of my final project of the Event Management course, I wanted to bring a feeling of real travelling to the people, who miss travelling during Covid-19 via the Interactive live Virtual tour.
And it worked amazingly!

34 attendees with their families followed the guide who was showing Saint Petersburg to them and actively participated in the tour. They decided where the guide will go next, which story will cover, shared their opinions on controversial questions via polls.

The participants got a feeling of travelling and togetherness (some of the event objectives) and truly enjoyed the experience.


I produced this event entirely individually from A to Z. I did everything from idea generation and audience research, brand development and social media plan, attendee and registration management (via Eventbrite), technical part (Zoom), 
risk management, to managing the event on the day (also sharing extra photos and videos related to the tour and managing the chat) and the event's evaluation. I have closely worked with the local guide (Yana) to create a balanced, engaging tour and learned a lot about virtual events during the process.

Feedback


"It is a great idea, especially nowadays when we cannot travel. I really liked that the tour was live and that there were interactive parts. I learned a lot actually, even though Iâ€™ve been living in St.Petersburg for 14 years in the past."


"It was good to see how flexible and smoothly you solved the difficulties as a team. Also I liked that Yana knew the information by heart and could improvise if necessary. I also liked the polls! And what I enjoyed the most the ambience because Yana was actually there."


"Thanks for such a great tour :) I can't wait for future tours"
