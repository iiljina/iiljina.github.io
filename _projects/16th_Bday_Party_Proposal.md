For the first project at the Event Management course I had to create a detailed proposal for a themed 16th birthday party for twins (boy and girl), their friends and parents.

After conducting the audience research, I came up with a travelling theme Birthday Party, as within this theme I could include most of the preferences of the diverse audience.

I have proposed to divide the venue into several areas - each area respresenting a different country and I have tailored all decorations, food, beverages, activities and entertainment tailored to the particular area. I presented my event's concept and the main event attributes in the short enthusiastic video pitch.

###Results and Feedback

Distinction


"There is so much that I loved about your project but what really stood out was the amount of thought you put into it. The way you interpreted the brief, then chose a creative theme and made sure it was the strong red thread across every element of the party - taking into consideration both the teens and the adults throughout - well done.

Youâ€™ve clearly put a vast amount of work into this project and it really shows.

Attention to detail is very strong - it is often the little things that win pitches.

Communications plan - a very thorough plan of what, how and when, relevant and on target, well done.

Budget - an exceptional budget, what stands out from others is the justification around items, clear reasons why you have spent what you have spent, an important aspect for the client - well done"

Clare Lawrence, Online Course Director, Events Academy

### Process and Learning Points

While working on the proposal I have contacted all the real suppliers and the venue. Therefore I was able to create an accurate budget, as well fit into the allocated funds.

While creating the timeline, function sheet, budget I realised that I enjoy working on the essential event documents, as well as developing the floorplans. You can find all the documents in the Leave Behind(add it as a button?).

I've aligned every detail of the event to the event goals, theme and preferences of the audience. I've put all my heart in this project and trully enjoyed working on every creative and operational detail of it.
Feel free to watch the recording of my pitch for this event proposal (above) and scroll through the Leave behind to merge into the Travel-themed party that I would be thrilled to organise in real life.
