A non-typical wedding, representing the bride and groom, and especially their passion for travelling.

I came up with so many travel-related details starting from decoration and name cards to ceremony's style and cake design, 
which has created a very special atmosphere and resulted in a personal, very memorable experience for every guest and exceeded the expectations of the bride and groom.

I've coordinated most of the preparation remotely, coming to Latvia a few times for site visits and meetings with vendors.

Get a glimpse of that special wedding yourself. Check the details below :)

### Table decorations

Each table was decorated in the style of the most distinctive country or region the bride and groom have visited:

Amsterdam table with famous Delft blue items and bikes (custom made at Amsterdam flea market bikes).

Vietnamese table with lanterns hanging from the ceilings like in Ho Anh (a small traditional Vietnamese town) and bright fans.

Russian table with Russian dolls, samovar, English-Russian dictionary (for all the non-Russian speaking guests who were seated at that table), traditional shawls decorated the chairs of ladies.

An Alpine table placed next to chimney with retro skies (borrowed from bride's father), pine trees decorated the chairs

The Caribbean table was decorated with cocos shells and exotic flowers in a pineapple

All my ideas for flower compositions were throughout discussed with the florist, who was happy to create a non-standard wedding decor (incl. Asian Ikebana, alpine horn, flowers in pineapple)

### Name cards with a meaning

Name written on special envelopes with a postcard and a fridge magnet sent from the newlyweds'"Big travel to married life".

On the envelopes: an old map of Amsterdam (where newlyweds live), the postal stamp of Riga (place of marriage), 
done on the date of marriage and a Dutch postage stamp with tulip with a year when newlyweds met.

Postcards inside envelopes are corresponding the table-country.

### Ceremony’s look and style

The wedding ceremony was like a flight to a happy marriage, with the last call and safety instructions.

The self-written wows were pronounced and rings exchanged standing between two nicely decorated hot air balloons (instead of the arch). 
Afterwards, the paper planes were thrown at newlyweds by the quests while 'Fly me To the Moon' was played in the background.

Two signposts with all the places where the guests come from, with the time of how long it takes to get there by foot or when it takes too long, by plane. 
Two pairs of hiking shoes were standing (put) at their base for the atmosphere and a photo moment.

### Multinational Wedding Traditions & Entertainment

Since the wedding theme was Travelling, the traditions and activities were also picked accordingly. 
Latvian, Russian, Jewish wedding traditions, as well as singing songs in different languages, and prizes - certificates in the shape of a plane ticket were all part of the thematic wedding.
