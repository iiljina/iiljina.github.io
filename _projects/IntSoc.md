With the International Student society of Newcastle University (IntSoc), my passion for organising events started. For two years, and especially when I was a societyâ€™s president, I was fully responsible for organising big monthly themed events and trips around the UK, small weekly events like comedy nights and pub quizzes for about 40(?) active members. Apart from organising those events, I was actively promoting them and the society online (on Facebook and emails) and in person, I was brainstorming for fresh event ideas, planned the events for the whole academic year and managed the budget for them.

I really enjoyed the community we created and expanded with a small but enthusiastic team of three. With IntSoc events, we provided the multicultural experience to 100+ international and local students, who discovered and experience different cultures, the UK, made lifelong connections and simply had fun.

In my third year in the Society, I was asked to become the Society's president. At the end of that year, I was one of the five students shortlisted in the Society Officer of the Year category of the ncl+ Extra-Curricular Activity Awards competition.

"The amount of work, effort and passion she has put into IntSoc Newcastle is unbelievable! And it made us the incredible organisation and community we are today!"
