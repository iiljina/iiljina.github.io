For the first project at the Event Management course I had to create a detailed proposal for a themed 16th birthday party for twins (boy and girl), their friends and parents.

After conducting the audience research, I came up with a travelling theme Birthday Party, as within this theme I could include most of the preferences of the diverse audience.

I have proposed to divide the venue into several areas - each area respresenting a different country and I have tailored all decorations, food, beverages, activities and entertainment tailored to the particular area. 
I presented my event's concept and the main event attributes in the short enthusiastic video pitch.

### Process and Learning Points

While working on the proposal I have contacted all the real suppliers and the venue. Therefore I was able to create an accurate budget, as well fit into the allocated funds.

While creating the timeline, function sheet, budget I realised that I enjoy working on the essential event documents, as well as developing the floorplans. 
You can find all the documents in the [Leave Behind][leave_behind].

I've aligned every detail of the event to the event goals, theme and preferences of the audience. I've put all my heart in this project and trully enjoyed working on every creative and operational detail of it.<br/>
Feel free to watch the recording of my pitch for this event proposal (above) and scroll through the [Leave Behind][leave_behind] to merge into the Travel-themed party that I would be thrilled to organise in real life.
