### The Task

Within this study project I was working at the proposal for event 3 (Red Carpet Activation).

{%

    size="one-third" 
    position="right"
%}

The main mission of the whole campaign was to bring the consumer closer to the action and demonstrate EE’s (telecommunication provider in UK) super-fast 5G network and its benefits during Bafta awards (UK’s Oscars) as well as to allow the audience to feel more of an emotional connection to the brand and show EE’s innovative technology.

For the event 3 (Red Carpet Activation) in particular the objectives were to come up with an activation that brings the mass audience right on the red carpet and involves an interactive experience and creative ideas for technologies. It also had to attract celebrities to EE stand on the red carpet.

### My Solutions

For online audience I proposed an **Interactive Streaming platform** that allows to **see Red Carpet event in 360 degrees** from the various viewpoints **including looking at the celebrities’ eyes**.

    text2=text2 size2="one-third"
%}

With a help of AR technologies and 5G, online viewers were supposed to have the chance to see **extra information about the celebrities** and **change the look of the area** where the host and the celebrity will be speaking **to match it to their (living) room’s style.**

Film world will become closer by bringing the favourite star of the viewer to a familiar environment.

To attract the celebrities on the red carpet I came up with a floating 3D EE logo and BAFTA’s symbol next to the sofa where the host was supposed to meet the celebrities.

You can see all the details in the [Leave Behind][leave_behind] (starting from page 20), as well as find all the event documents there.

I have also done the extensive social media & marketing plan for Red Carpet Activation and a deep research on most recent (for summer of 2020) event technologies, the benefits of superfast 5G network and its influence on events.

### Result and Feedback

> Distinction
> 
> This is one of the strongest answers I have had to this brief. Each event responds to the brief well, with innovation and tech at the forefront. But also, the link between the live exclusive events to the public, that mass reach, has been managed so well. I am very impressed.
>
> Interpreting the brief – so strong here, you really listened to client and interpreted the brief well, delivering a strong creative concept, with so much tech and innovation at the heart of it to meet all the objectives, well done.
>
> Justification – very strong here. I like the research section, for example when you reference the neuroscientists, how many millennials have VR, this gives your proposals real weight.
>
> You explained the “why” at every stage. And I really liked that you referenced the emotional connection & ‘bringing closer to action’ on numerous occasions. 
>
> Marketing – in the most part this was well delivered very well with lots of proposals in particular for the red-carpet event on how to engage, pre, during and post event.”
