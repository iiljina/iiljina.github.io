In summer 2020 well known worldwide Language cafe was looking for volunteers to reactivate the language cafe in Amsterdam. So I applied, and we together with one more volunteer found the venue (corona proof) reactivated the Facebook page of Bla Bla Language Caffe Amsterdam and organised two successful Bla Bla events full of participants. We stopped because of Corona regulations, but plan to continue, as the event was very popular and we too truly enjoyed it.
