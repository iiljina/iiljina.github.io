In summer 2020 a well known worldwide Language caffe was looking for volunteers to reactivate the language cafe in Amsterdam. Together with one more volunteer we found the venue (corona proof) reactivated the Facebook page of Bla Bla Language Caffe Amsterdam and organised two successful Bla Bla events full of participants. We stopped because of Corona regulations, but plan to continue, as the event was very popular and we truly enjoyed it ourselves too.
