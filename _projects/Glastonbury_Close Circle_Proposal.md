As a first group project of the Event Management Postgraduate course, we had to come up witha  side event at glastonbury Festival, which would bring the artists closer to the audience. We developed and proposed a concept of a living room concert, inviting the audience to step into the world of the artist and join his or her close circle.

I massively enjoyed developing Close Circle concept while working on the production plan and details, social media plan and event evaluation, ticket management and attendee management plans, interaction with the artist. I have also created a Production Schedule (or timeline) and a Function sheet.

Feel free to have a look at the proposal(button) to see all the exciting details of the Close Circle event.

### Process and Learning Points

With two of my coursemates, we worked as a real event agency, overcoming the difficulties, answering arising questions and challenges. For example, on the last third before the deadline, our fourth teammate suddenly dropped out of the course and left us with totally uncompeled Sponsorship part she was responsible for.  I have immediately dived into the sponsorship topic and swiftly developed the sponsorship packages so the project still could be delivered on time.

Besides, I was also a project manager of our team, making sure that we as a team don't deviate from the brief (event objectives) and will deliver the project on time, as well as ensuring that no useful information or idea is lost. Few times I had to be persistent and firmly explain why we should do this way and not the other. Afterwards, the team thanked me for my persistence. Our proposal was evaluated as one of the best in the entire course history. 

I was also the team player who motivated the others to stay positive and deliver everything at teh highest standards despite the tiredeness and extra challenges that came our way.

Close Circle project was a real rollercoaster with ups and downs, miscommunications, as well as the unity of ideas and eureka moments. I learned a lot about various aspects of event management, improved my interpersonal and leadership skills.

### Result and Feedback


Distinction


"OVERALL – the amount of work that you have put into this project is so evident. Through all the issues you had, with one team member dropping out just a few weeks before the submission date. You really stepped up and showed how much passion you have for this industry and how much you want to do well in this PG course. I have been incredibly impressed, well done.


The project proposal is so perfectly on brief, your delivery is well executed and the attention to detail is surely going to win you pitches.


Team dynamics – strong, presented very much as a team not 3 individuals, all know the content. Clients will take the way you interact at a pitch as a reflection of how work together in the planning and on their live event. Strong teams get hired….I would hire you!

Bringing it to life – your slides are very strong, they contain so much useful information.

Clarity – well done for delivering such a full proposal, with so much going on, above and beyond the brief.

Interpreting the brief – so strong here, you really listened to the client and interpreted the brief well, delivering a strong creative concept to meet the objectives, well done.

Justification throughout good – very strong part of your pitch, you explained the “why” at every stage.

Creative theming - as mentioned above you delivered above and beyond the brief, using extra elements to surprise, entertain and delight the audience, including a selfie zone, wall art installation.

Structure/Production – delivered on the details, how you would bring your concept to life through your dressing of the space and the tech aspects.

Logistics – many small elements of attention, for example, the use of colour coding, making zones so that you can manage the audience in the time given, it’s the little elements that stand out and win your work

Social Media – strong strategic plan, well delivered.

Documentation – well delivered"
