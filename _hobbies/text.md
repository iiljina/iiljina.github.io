I enjoy discovering new places, meeting new and old friends, trying new activities (e.g yoga with goats, drama classes, bungee dance). I love learning new things and daily broaden my horizons, developing both personally and professionally.

I just love planning trips, finding the most interesting places and experiences, developing not trivial itineraries. Over the last 5 years, I have organised countless trips with family and friends and visited 20+ countries.
