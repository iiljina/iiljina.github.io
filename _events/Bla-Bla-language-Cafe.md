In summer 2020 a well known worldwide Bla Bla Language Cafe was looking for volunteers to reactivate the language exchange meetings in Amsterdam. Together with one more volunteer we found the venue (corona proof) reactivated the Facebook page of Bla Bla Language Exchange Amsterdam and organised two successful events full of participants.<br/>
We stopped because of Corona regulations, but plan to continue, as the event was very popular and we truly enjoyed it ourselves too.
