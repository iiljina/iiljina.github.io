In summer 2020 a well known worldwide Bla Bla Language Exchange was looking for volunteers to reactivate the language exchange meetings in Amsterdam. Together with one more volunteer we found the venue (corona proof) reactivated the Facebook page of Bla Bla Language Exchange Amsterdam and organised two successful events full of participants.<br/>
We stopped because of Corona regulations, but plan to continue, as the event was very popular and we truly enjoyed it ourselves too.

2021 October Update:
We keep organising Bla Bla Language Exchange meetings, we have also onboarded more volunteers.
So almost every week and when the government measures allow, old and new expats come to practice their favourite languages (English and Dutch are the favourites) or just to spend a cosy evening with their new friends they've made there.
